# New York Harbor

New York harbor is a gateway, a face and a landscape: it is a
front door, an icon and a place where people live. This harbor is one of the
largest, and through it has passed most of what constitutes its country,
personally, intellectually and commercially.

But it is also a home. 20 million people live here. Hundreds of species of
animals and plants live here. It holds countless stories.

It is fragile, as well. Wars have been fought across it. Terrorist attacks
have scarred it. Hurricanes have flooded it.

This is a living, pulsing place. We have built it out onto the water;
sometimes, the water tries to reclaim its lost shape. These maps are
intended to highlight the physical relationship between land and water in
defining the concept that is New York Harbor.

New York is, to begin with, a lot of land: notice what happens if we assume
everything that is at sea level is land. Brooklyn is a vast and expansive
plain, Manhattan is a land-bridge and Staten Peninsula is no island. There's
deep water, too, right off the coast of all this land.

The problem, though, is that some of what we saw wasn't land. Because, in
fact, some of what is at sea level is water. And when we assume that water
will go everywhere that it can, Manhattan and Staten become islands again,
but at the cost of the Rockaways and huge portions of SI.

No, you see, the problem is that New York Harbor has begun to press back in
against the city so forcefully pushing out. The humanity that occupies it
has tried to explode New York Harbor into something entirely artificial, but
the harbor will not be cowed.

The harbor is not the bizarre landscape of the first picture. It will not be
altered. It will not lose its self.
