# New York Harbor

The harbor just off New York City is full of stories. It is a thriving
commercial port. Its history is that of its country; it is a front door. It
is a landscape, too, the habitat of 20 million people and hundreds of
animal species. It is a home.

Countless organisms have poured out their lives and experiences and dreams
here. This harbor pulses with activity, and we have pushed our very being
into it. We humans have dominated our harbor: we build our home right
out onto the water. Our city ignores the harbor's very presence in its way.

But the harbor is not without complaint. It remembers that Manhattan is more
than a land-bridge and crouches, ready to pounce on Brooklyn. It has
created an island from Staten's Peninsula.

The harbor is alive, and it is waiting to claim its inheritance. We have
lived and loved and thereby offered ourselves as a sacrifice. Geography can
wait; it knows that one day, it will win in a bar-fight.
